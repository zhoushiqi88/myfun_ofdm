# FUN OFDM #

This project is an 802.11a OFDM PHY layer implementation written in C++ for use with Ettus USRPs. It contains both transmitter and receiver blocks and were tested with USRP N210s + XCVR 2450 daughterboards. These blocks are provided separately so that they can be used individually. They can also be easily combined into a single transceiver, but that is left up to the user because how they interact with each other should be controlled by the MAC layer which is outside the scope of this project. Note: A simple transceiver example is provided in the examples directory of the project.

The [Official FUN OFDM API can be found here!](http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/funlab/fun_ofdm/index.html)

# Getting Set Up #

## Hardware Requirements ##

__1. USRP N2XX__

This project was built for and tested with USRP N210s. It may be updated in the future to work with the B200/210's as well, but for now if you want to use B210s you will need to update the USRP class appropriately.

__2. Gigabit Ethernet Port__

Each USRP requires its own gigabit ethernet port.

__3. Second Generation Intel i5/i7 processor (or equivalent) and 8 GB RAM__

The transmitter is not very computationally complex. However, the receiver runs about 6 threads with about each one performing O(N) complex multiplications each. Therefore, to run the receiver (either by itself or as part of a transceiver) it is recommended that you have at least a 2nd generation Intel i5/i7 or equivalent and at least 8 GB of RAM.


## Dependencies ##

### CMake (>= 3.9) ###

This project uses the CMake build system to check for dependencies and auto-generate all the necessary Makefiles. For more information see the [CMake Website](http://www.cmake.org/).

On a debian based system you can also install CMake throught apt-get such as:

~~~
sudo apt-get install cmake
~~~

### Make ###

Make is required for the CMake build system. More information can be found at [GNU Make homepage](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

On a debian based system you can also install make throught apt-get such as:

~~~
sudo apt-get install make
~~~

### Doxygen (optional) ###

Doxygen is used to auto-generate html documentation. If you want to build a local copy of the API you will need to have Doxygen installed. More information can be found at the [Doxygen website](http://www.doxygen.org)

On a debian based system you can also install doxygen throught apt-get such as:

~~~
sudo apt-get install doxygen
~~~

You can also install a GUI tool call doxy-wizard through apt-get:

~~~
sudo apt-get install doxygen-gui
~~~

On MacOS a .dmg can be downloaded from the doxygen.org website by clicking on the downloads link.

Note: After installing the .dmg, you will have to find the App in Finder and ctrl-click open it
the first time otherwise MacOS won't let you open it for security reasons

### UHD ###

Universal Hardware Driver (UHD) is the library, provided by Ettus, that is used to communicated with the USRPs. For installation instructions see:

[UHD Manual] (http://http://files.ettus.com/manual/)

On a debian based system you can also install UHD throught apt-get such as:

~~~
sudo apt-get install libuhd-dev
~~~

Or you can follow the [build guide] (http://files.ettus.com/manual/page_build_guide.html) to build from source

### FFTW3 ###

FFTW version 3 is the library used for computing the Fast Fourier Transforms. For more information see the [FFTW project home page] (http://www.fftw.org/index.html).

On a debian based system the easiest way to install FFTW3 is to use apt-get such as:

~~~
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-3
~~~
or
~~~
sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev
~~~

There are also instructions in their website (linked above) to install from source.

### Boost ###

Boost is required for UHD. It is also used for the CRC and time functions.

On a debian based system the easiest way to install Boost is to use apt-get such as:

~~~
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
~~~

To install from source download download the latest source and build it locally such as:

~~~
tar xvf boost_1_x_y.tar.bzip2
cd boost_1_x_y
./bootstrap.sh
./b2 -j4
~~~

This project assumes that boost is installed in /usr/local/ by default

You can find more detailed installation instructions on the [Boost Website](http://www.boost.org/).

### pthread ###

Posix threads (pthread) is the library used for handling all of the threading in the receiver chain. You should already
have the pthread library as it comes with the linux kernel but if you can also get/update it with apt-get such as:

~~~
sudo apt-get install libpthread-stubs0-dev
~~~

## Build ##

### Compile ###

The easiest way to compile the code is to download it come github (clone) and then use CMake & make.

~~~
git clone https://github.com/bmorgan5/fun_ofdm.git
cd fun_ofdm
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
~~~

### Install (Optional) ###

If you want to install the project and use it as a library you can use the install target after you have compiled everything:

~~~
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
~~~

*Note: Don't forget the 'ldconfig' command, otherwise gcc won't be able to find your newly installed fun_ofdm library.

### Documentation (Optional) ###

The project uses Doxygen to auto-generate html API documentation. To build the documentation locally:

~~~
cd docs/doxygen/
doxygen Doxyfile
open html/index.html
~~~

# Testing #

## Simulation ##

The easiest way to test that everything built correctly is to run *sim* in the fun_ofdm/bin directory as this does not require any USRPs to be connected. The source code for this example can be found in fun_ofdm/examples/test_sim.cpp. If everything compiled correctly you should see an output that looks something like:


> [path to fun_ofdm]/fun_ofdm/bin $ sudo ./sim
> I'm a little tea pot, short and stout.....here is my handle.....blah blah blah.....this rhyme sucks!I'm a little tea pot, short and stout.....here is my handle.....blah blah blah.....this rhyme sucks!I'm a little tea pot, short and stout.....here is my handle.....blah blah blah.....this rhyme sucks!
>

>
> Received 100 packets
>
> Time elapsed: 1500.481000

## Test Tx ##

To test that the transmitter is working you can run *test_tx* in the fun_ofdm/bin directory. This test requires a USRP so be sure to have one plugged connected properly. (To test if your computer can see the USRP you can use 'uhd_find_devices'). The source code for this can be found in fun_ofdm/examples/test_tx. If everything goes as expected you should see soemthing like:

> [path to download dir]/fun_ofdm/bin $ sudo ./test_tx
>
> linux; GNU C++ version 4.8.1; Boost_105300; UHD_003.007.001-72-g383061d8

>
> Sending packet 999 of 1000 at 1/2 BPSK
>
> Sending packet 1000 of 1000 at 1/2 BPSK

## Test Rx ##

Testing the receiver is a bit more complicated. This test requires at least one USRP for the receiver, but you will probably want to have a second USRP so that you can transmit packets for the receiver to receive as well. To do this,
first run test_rx in the fun_ofdm/bin directory. If you are on a clear channel and don't have anything transmitting you will probably see something like this:

> [path to download dir]/fun_ofdm/bin $ sudo ./test_rx
>
> linux; GNU C++ version 4.8.1; Boost_105300; UHD_003.007.001-72-g383061d8
>
> Testing receive chain...
>
> Instantiating the usrp.
>
> -- Opening a USRP2/N-Series device...
>
> -- Current recv frame size: 1472 bytes
>
> -- Current send frame size: 1472 bytes
>
> -- Detecting internal GPSDO.... No GPSDO found
>
> -- not found
>
> Invalid CRC (length 709)
>
> Invalid CRC (length 3050)
>

Don't worry about the 'Invalid CRC (length 709)' as this just indicates a false alarm that was successfully detected and dropped when the CRC failed in the frame decoder block.

Once you have the receiver up and running you can then run *test_tx* to transmit some packets for the receiver to receive. If everything works as expected you should see something like this:

> [path to download dir]/fun_ofdm/bin $ sudo ./test_rx
>
> linux; GNU C++ version 4.8.1; Boost_105300; UHD_003.007.001-72-g383061d8

Depending on the PHY Rate used at the transmitter and if you are lucky (as I was when I ran this test) you will receive all transmitted packets. However, as long as you receive anywhere >90% of transmitted packets you can safely assume that you have everything set up correctly.

# Usage #

This project was developed as a library for furthering wireless communications research in the Fundamentals of Networking lab (FUNLAB) at the University of Washington and is released under GPL V2 for anybody to use/modify however they like.

The full API is available on the funlab website: [fun_ofdm API](http://www.ee.washington.edu/research/funlab/fun_ofdm/index.html).

## Parameters ##

The main parameters used for the transmitter / receiver are as follows:

* freq        - Center frequence [default=5.72e9 (5.72 GHz)]
* sample_rate - AD/DA sampling frequency (also corresponds to bandwidth) [default=5e6 (5 MHz)]
* tx_gain     - Output amplifier gain (0-35 on USRP N210) [default=20]
* rx_gain     - Input amplifier gain  (0-35 on USRP N210) [default=20]
* tx_amp 		  - Scale factor for transmit samples. Used to give finer control over output power. [default=1]
* device_addr - IP Address of USRP as a string. An empty string will automatically find an eligable USRP [default=""]

* phy_rate 	  - The modulation and coding rate used when building the phy frames [default=1_2_BPSK (BPSK w/ Rate R=1/2 Convolutional Code)]

## Transmitter ##

Building the transmitter and sending packets is very easy. The following code snippet builds a transmitter object with the default USRP parameters and sends a single packet.

~~~
...

usrp_params params = usrp_params();
transmitter tx = transmitter(params);

std::string s = "Hello World";
std::vector<unsigned char> data = std::vector<unsigned char>(12);
memcpy(&data[0], &s[0], 12);
tx.send_packet(data);

...

~~~

## Receiver ##

Similarly, building the receiver and receiving packets is just as. The following code snippet builds a receiver object with the default USRP parameters and passes a function pointer to the callback function aptly named 'callback'.

~~~
...

usrp_params params = usrp_params();
receiver rx = receiver(&callback, params);

while(1) sleep(1); //Let the main thread spin while the receive threads receives packets

...
~~~

## Simple Transciever ##

Putting the above two examples together we can make a very simple transceiver using the default USRP parameters that receives for 4 seconds then transmits a single packet and repeats. *Note: the callback function is only called if the receiver actually successfully receives a packet. In this case the contents of the packet are simply printed to standard out (i.e. the terminal). If the receiver doesn't receive anything then essentially nothing happens.

~~~
int main()
{

    usrp_params params = usrp_params();
    transmitter tx = transmitter(params);
    receiver rx = receiver(&callback, params);

    std::string s = "Hello World";
    std::vector<unsigned char> data = std::vector<unsigned char>(12);
    memcpy(&data[0], &s[0], 12);
    tx.send_packet(data);

    while(1)
    {
        sleep(4);
        rx.pause();
        tx.send_packet(data);
        cout << "Sending \"Hello World\" " << std::endl;
        rx.resume();
    }

    return 0;
}

void callback(std::vector<std::vector<unsigned char> > payloads)
{
    for(int i = 0; i < payloads.size(); i++)
    {
        std::cout << "Received a packet" << std::endl;
    }

}
~~~

This example only needs one USRP to be connected since the transmitter and receiver as the code is never trying to transmit and receive at the same time.

The full code for this simple transcieiver can be found in the examples directory titled simple_transciver.cpp. *Note: this file assumes that the fun_ofdm library has been installed to the system instead of being build locally.


# Troubleshooting #

+ Can you see your USRP with 'uhd_find_device'?
+ Did you run the examples using as root (i.e. 'sudo')?
+ Have you tried different gain / tx_amp settings?
+ Did you run 'ldconfig' after 'sudo make install'?
+ Are both the transmitter and receiver using the same center freq? sample rate?
+ Are compiler optimizations turned on (they are turned on by default in the top level CMakeLists.txt)
+ If you see 'D's printed to the screen that might indicate hardware problems
	+ Could be your ethernet card - see the sysconf changes recommended by Ettus
	+ Could be your processor is too slow/too busy
	+ Could be not enough Ram available

# Contact #

For help troubleshooting please make sure to include the following:

+ Operating System (Ubuntu, Linx Mint, etc.) and version
+ USRP & Daughtercard (USRP N210 & XCVR 2450)
+ What parameters you are using (freq, sample rate, etc)
+ What you are trying to do/what is not working
+ Any other useful information

Any helpful feedback (i.e. anything that isn't spam or trolling) is much appreciate!
