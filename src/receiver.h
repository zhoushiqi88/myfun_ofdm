     * \brief The receiver class is the public interface for the fun_ofdm receiver.
     *  This is the easiest way to start receiving 802.11a OFDM frames out of the box.
     *
     *  Usage: To receive packets simply create a receiver object and pass it a callback
     *  function that takes a std::vector<std::vector<unsigned char> > as an input parameter.
     *  The receiver object then automatically creates a separate thread that pulls samples
     *  from the USRP and processes them with the receive chain. The received packets (if any)
     *  are then passed into the callback function where the user is able to process them further.
     *
     *  If at any time the user wishes to pause the receiver (i.e. so that the user can transmit
     *  some packets) the user simply needs to call the receiver::pause() function on the receiver
     *  object. Similarly, the receiver::resume() function can then be used to begin receiving again
     *  after a pause.
